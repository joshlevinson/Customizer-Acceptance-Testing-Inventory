# I want to make sure the "Site Title" input works

Given a logged in user

- I navigate to the customizer
- I click the "Site Identity" section
- I fill in the "Site Title" field with "Sample Title"
- I see "Sample Title" on the page
- I save the Customizer
- I see "Sample Title" saved as the blogname setting
